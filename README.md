# Metro_Card_Reservation_System
I developed a Metro Card Reservation System using MySQL. I created tables with primary and foreign keys, applied constraints like UNIQUE and CHECK, inserted records, and performed queries using joins, aggregate functions, subqueries, UNION, and string/date functions to manage and analyze metro card data efficiently.
